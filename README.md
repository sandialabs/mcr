# Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) using Principal Components Inputs and Rigorous Equality and Inequality Constraints

This MATLAB pseudocode perform multivariate curve resolution (MCR) using PCA scores & loadings of data  as inputs. It employs rigorous least squares equality and inequality constraints for all elements in the solution factor matrices. It also can be used to perform nonnegative matrix factorization.
